The goal of ohcrabgit is for me to learn a bit of Rust by re-creating my [saperlipopette](https://docs.ropensci.org/saperlipopette/) R package.

## Current exercises

Currently only `ohcrabgit small_change` will work and create a folder `exo-small_change` above the current folder.
In this folder, open the `instructions.txt` file to know what the exercise is about.

The binary lives in `target/release/ohcrabgit` but I need to remember to update it.

## Current issues/ideas

- how best to create file paths.
- where to best create exercises folders (temporary directory).
- display a list of possible exercises.
- do not panic if no argument.
- how to document the thing.
